    "In this tutorial, we will learn how to understand and work with runtime context and session management in Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime. This example demonstrates how AgentCore Runtime handles sessions, maintains context across multiple invocations, and how agents can access runtime information through the context object.\n",

    "4. **Payload Flexibility**: How to pass custom data to agents through the payload\n",

    "## Understanding Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime Sessions\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into the code, it's important to understand how Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime manages sessions:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Session Isolation and Security\n",
    "\n",
    "AgentCore Runtime provides **complete session isolation** through dedicated microVMs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dedicated Resources**: Each session runs in its own microVM with isolated CPU, memory, and filesystem\n",
    "- **Security Boundaries**: Complete separation between user sessions prevents data contamination\n",
    "- **Deterministic Cleanup**: After session completion, the microVM is terminated and memory is sanitized\n",
    "\n",
    "### Session Lifecycle\n",
    "\n",
    "Sessions in AgentCore Runtime follow a specific lifecycle:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Creation**: A new session is created on first invocation with a unique `runtimeSessionId`\n",
    "2. **Active State**: Session processes requests and maintains context\n",
    "3. **Idle State**: Session waits for next invocation while preserving context\n",
    "4. **Termination**: Session ends due to:\n",
    "   - Inactivity (15 minutes)\n",
    "   - Maximum lifetime (8 hours)\n",
    "   - Health check failures\n",
    "\n",
    "### Context Persistence\n",
    "\n",
    "Within a session, AgentCore Runtime maintains:\n",
    "- **Conversation History**: Previous interactions and responses\n",
    "- **Application State**: Variables and objects created during execution\n",
    "- **File System**: Any files created or modified during the session\n",
    "- **Environment Variables**: Custom settings and configurations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Session Management Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unique Session IDs**: Generate unique session IDs for each user or conversation\n",
    "- **Context Reuse**: Use the same session ID for related invocations to maintain context\n",
    "- **Session Boundaries**: Use different session IDs for different users or unrelated conversations\n",
    "- **Ephemeral Nature**: Don't rely on sessions for permanent data storage (use AgentCore Memory for persistence)"

    "## Understanding Session Management in AgentCore Runtime\n",
    "\n",
    "The code above demonstrates several key concepts about how AgentCore Runtime manages sessions and provides context to agents:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Context Object Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The `context` parameter in your entrypoint function provides access to runtime information:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@app.entrypoint\n",
    "def strands_agent_bedrock_handling_context(payload, context):\n",
    "    # Access session information\n",
    "    session_id = context.session_id\n",
    "    # Use context information in your agent logic\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Session Continuity Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "Within a single session, AgentCore Runtime provides:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Persistent Environment**: Variables and state persist across invocations\n",
    "2. **Context Preservation**: The agent can reference previous interactions\n",
    "3. **Resource Reuse**: Initialized models and tools remain loaded\n",
    "4. **Performance Benefits**: Reduced cold start times for subsequent invocations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Session Isolation Guarantees\n",
    "\n",
    "AgentCore Runtime ensures complete isolation between sessions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Security**: Each session runs in its own microVM with isolated resources\n",
    "- **Privacy**: No data leakage between different user sessions\n",
    "- **Reliability**: Issues in one session don't affect others\n",
    "- **Cleanup**: Complete memory sanitization after session termination\n",
    "\n",
    "### Payload Flexibility\n",
    "\n",
    "The `payload` parameter allows flexible data passing:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example payload structures\n",
    "payload = {\n",
    "    \"prompt\": \"User's question\",\n",
    "    \"user_id\": \"1\",\n",
    "    \"preferences\": {...},\n",
    "    \"context_data\": {...}\n",

    "## Understanding the Session Management Results\n",
    "\n",
    "The demonstrations above showcase several key aspects of AgentCore Runtime's session management:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Session Continuity (Session 1)\n",
    "- **First invocation**: Agent responds to weather question and acknowledges user name\n",
    "- **Second invocation**: Agent performs calculation (2×5=10)\n",
    "- **Third invocation**: Agent references previous result (\"that plus 34\" = 44)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Learning**: The agent maintained context across multiple invocations within the same session, remembering the calculation result from the previous interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Session Isolation (Session 2)\n",
    "- **New session ID**: Created a completely new session\n",
    "- **Same user**: Used the same user ID but different session\n",
    "- **Context loss**: Agent cannot reference previous calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Learning**: Even with the same user, a new session creates a completely isolated environment with no access to previous context.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. User and Session Isolation (Session 3)\n",
    "- **Different user**: Mani instead of Maira\n",
    "- **New session**: Complete isolation from previous sessions\n",
    "- **Fresh context**: Agent starts with clean state\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Learning**: Each session provides complete isolation, ensuring privacy and security between different users and interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Context Object Usage\n",
    "Throughout all invocations, the agent:\n",
    "- Accessed the runtime context via `context.session_id`\n",
    "- Processed custom payload data (`user_id`, `prompt`)\n",
    "- Maintained logging and debugging information\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Learning**: The context object provides valuable runtime information that agents can use for enhanced functionality and debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Session Management Best Practices Demonstrated\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use consistent session IDs** for conversational continuity\n",
    "2. **Generate unique session IDs** for different users or conversations\n",
    "3. **Leverage context information** for enhanced agent behavior\n",
    "4. **Design for session boundaries** - don't assume persistence across sessions\n",
    "5. **Handle graceful context loss** when sessions change or expire\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cleanup (Optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now clean up the AgentCore Runtime created"
