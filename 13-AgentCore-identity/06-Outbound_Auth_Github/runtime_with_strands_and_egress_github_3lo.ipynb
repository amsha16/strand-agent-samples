    "# Outbound Auth\n",
    "\n",
    "Outbound Auth allows agents and the AgentCore Gateway to securely access AWS resources and third-party services on behalf of users who have been authenticated and authorized during Inbound Auth. To integrate authorization with an AWS resource or third-party service, it's necessary to configure both Inbound Auth and Outbound Auth.\n",
    "\n",
    "With just-enough access and secure permission delegation supported by AgentCore Identity, agents can seamlessly and securely access AWS resources and third-party tools such as GitHub, Google, Salesforce, and Slack. Agents can perform actions on these services either on behalf of users or independently, provided there is pre-authorized user consent. Additionally, you can reduce consent fatigue using a secure token vault and create streamlined AI agent experiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outbound Authentication Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you register your client application with third-party providers and then create an Outbound Auth. You specify how you want to validate access to the AWS resource or third-party service or AgentCore Gateway targets. You can use OAuth 2LO/3LO or API keys. With OAuth, you can select from providers that AgentCore Identity provides. In which case you enter the configuration details for the providers from AgentCore Identity. Alternatively, you can supply details for a custom provider. \n",
    "\n",
    "When a user wants access to an AWS resource or third-party service or AgentCore Gateway target, the Outbound Auth confirms that the access tokens provided by Incoming Auth are valid and if so, allows access to the resource.\n",

    "## Resource credential providers\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a component that agent  uses to retrieve credentials of downstream resource servers (e.g., Google, GitHub) to access them, e.g., fetch private repos from Github.  It removes the heavy-lifting of agent developers implementing 2LO and 3LO OAuth2 orchestration flows across end-users, agent code, and external authorization servers. AgentCore provides both a custom OAuth2 credential provider and a list of built-in providers such Google, GitHub, Slack, Salesforce with authorization server endpoint and provider-specific parameters pre-filled.\n",

    "Bedrock AgentCore Identity provides OAuth2 and API Key Credential Providers for agent developers to authenticate with external resources that support OAuth2 or API key. In the following example, we will walk you through configuring an API Key credential provider.  An agent can then use the API Key credential provider to retrieve the API key for any agent operations.

    "1. Invoke agent – Your agent code invokes GetResourceOauth2Token API to retrieve an authorization URL, when an originating agent user wants to access some application or resource that he/she owns.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Generate authorization URL – AgentCore Identity generates an authorization URL and session URI for the user to navigate to and consent access.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Authorize and obtain access token – The user navigates to the authorization URL and grants consent for your agent to access his/her resource. After that, AgentCore Identity redirects the user's browser to your HTTPS application endpoint with information containing the originating user of the authorization request. At this point, your HTTPS application endpoint determines if the originating agent user is still the same as the currently logged in user of your application. If they match, your application endpoint invokes CompleteResourceTokenAuth so that AgentCore Identity can fetch and store the access token.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Re-invoke agent to obtain access token – Once the application returns a valid response, your agent application will be able to retrieve the OAuth2.0 access tokens that were originally requested for the user. If the users do not match, your application simply does nothing or logs the attempt.\n",
    "\n",
    "By allowing your application endpoint to verify the user identity, AgentCore Identity allows your agent application to ensure that it is always the same user who initiated the authorization request and the one who consented access.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview of the OAuth2 Session Binding Flow in this sample\n",
    "\n",
    "The OAuth2 session binding process involves several key steps that coordinate between your application, AgentCore Identity, external OAuth providers (like Github, Google, etc ), and a local callback server:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Create Application Callback URL\n",
    "- Create a publicly accessible HTTPS callback endpoint in your application\n",
    "- This endpoint will handle OAuth redirects and validate user sessions\n",
    "- Example: `https://myagentapp.com/callback`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Update Workload Identity with Callback URL\n",
    "- Register your callback URL as an `AllowedResourceOauth2ReturnUrl` in the workload identity\n",
    "- This is accomplished using the `UpdateWorkloadIdentity` API\n",
    "- **In this tutorial**: This step is handled automatically by the code below that updates the workload identity with the environment-aware callback server URL\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Create OAuth2 Credential Provider\n",
    "- Configure the credential provider with external OAuth provider details (client ID, secret)\n",
    "- AgentCore Identity returns a unique callback URL for the provider\n",
    "- Register this callback URL with the external OAuth provider (e.g., GitHub Console)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 4: Implement Session Validation and Token Completion\n",
    "- Your callback endpoint must validate the current user's session\n",
    "- Call `CompleteResourceTokenAuth` API with the user identifier and session URI\n",
    "- **In this tutorial**: The `oauth2_callback_server.py` handles this automatically\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 5: OAuth Flow Execution\n",
    "- User triggers OAuth flow through agent interaction\n",
    "- User is redirected to external provider for authorization\n",
    "- Provider redirects back to your callback with session information\n",
    "- Session binding completes and OAuth tokens become available\n",
    "\n",
    "### Environment-Aware OAuth2 Callback Server\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial uses an environment-aware `oauth2_callback_server.py` that automatically adapts to different execution environments:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Local Development:**\n",
    "- **External Callback URL**: `http://localhost:9090/oauth2/callback` (browser-accessible)\n",
    "- **Internal Communication**: `http://localhost:9090` (notebook ↔ server)\n",
    "- **Server Binding**: `127.0.0.1` (localhost only, secure)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **SageMaker Workshop Studio:**\n",
    "- **External Callback URL**: `https://<domain>.studio.<region>.sagemaker.aws/proxy/9090/oauth2/callback` (browser-accessible via proxy)\n",
    "- **Internal Communication**: `http://localhost:9090` (notebook ↔ server in same container)\n",
    "- **Server Binding**: `0.0.0.0` (allows SageMaker proxy to reach server)\n",
    "\n",
    "The OAuth2 callback server automatically detects the environment by checking for `/opt/ml/metadata/resource-metadata.json` and configures itself accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Features of oauth2_callback_server.py\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Runs a Local FastAPI Server** (port 9090)\n",
    "   - Provides `/ping` endpoint for health checks\n",
    "   - Provides `/userIdentifier/token` endpoint to store user tokens\n",
    "   - Provides `/oauth2/callback` endpoint to handle OAuth redirects\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Manages User Token Storage**\n",
    "   - Stores the user's JWT token from Cognito authentication\n",
    "   - Associates OAuth sessions with the correct user identity\n",
    "\n",

    "### Integration with Workload Identity Update\n",
    "\n",
    "The code performs a crucial step in the OAuth2 session binding process:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if launch_result.agent_id:\n",
    "    workload_name = launch_result.agent_id\n",
    "    workload_identity = identity_client.get_workload_identity(name=workload_name)\n",
    "    allowed_resource_oauth_2_return_urls = workload_identity.get(\"allowedResourceOauth2ReturnUrls\") or []\n",
    "    oauth2_callback_url = get_oauth2_callback_url()\n",
    "    print(f\"Updating workload {workload_name} with callback url {oauth2_callback_url}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    updated_workload_identity = identity_client.update_workload_identity(\n",
    "        name=workload_name,\n",
    "        allowed_resource_oauth_2_return_urls=[*allowed_resource_oauth_2_return_urls, oauth2_callback_url],\n",
    "    )\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This code:\n",
    "1. **Retrieves the Agent's Workload Identity**: Uses the agent ID from the runtime deployment\n",
    "2. **Gets Current Allowed URLs**: Fetches existing `allowedResourceOauth2ReturnUrls`\n",
    "3. **Adds Environment-Aware Callback URL**: \n",
    "   - Local: `http://localhost:9090/oauth2/callback`\n",
    "   - SageMaker: `https://<domain>.studio.sagemaker.aws/proxy/9090/oauth2/callback`\n",
    "4. **Updates Workload Identity**: Registers the callback URL with AgentCore Identity\n",
    "\n",
    "This registration is essential because AgentCore Identity will only redirect OAuth callbacks to pre-registered URLs, providing an additional security layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Security Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "The OAuth2 session binding process includes several security measures:\n",
    "- **URL Validation**: Only pre-registered callback URLs are allowed\n",
    "- **Session Verification**: User sessions must be validated before token completion\n",
    "- **User Identity Binding**: OAuth sessions are explicitly bound to authenticated users\n",
    "- **Token Isolation**: Each user's OAuth tokens are isolated and secure\n",
    "- **Environment-Aware URLs**: Automatically uses appropriate URLs for each environment\n",
    "\n",
    "This comprehensive approach ensures that OAuth2 flows are secure and properly attributed to the correct users in multi-user environments, whether running locally or in SageMaker Workshop Studio.\n",
