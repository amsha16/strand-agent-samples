    "## Understanding Interleaved Thinking\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Interleaved Thinking?\n",
    "\n",
    "Interleaved thinking is a new capability in Claude 4 models that allows the model to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Think between tool calls**: Process and reason about results before deciding next steps\n",
    "2. **Chain multiple tools with reasoning**: Make sophisticated multi-step decisions\n",
    "3. **Adapt strategies dynamically**: Change approach based on intermediate results\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a lot of similarities between Agent's event loop implemented with and without interleaved thinking:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Query → LLM is thinking -> LLM decides to call a Tool -> Event Loop calls the Tool -> Ouput is sent back to LLM -> [ this continues until LLM no longer needs to call any tools - it rendered the Final Answer ]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference you'll notice with the interleaved thinking is that Event loop is acting on LLM's \"thoughts\", rather than \"decisions\". Notice the second link in the loop above, called \"thinking\". In a traditional event loop, the thoughts are hidden. We have to wait until LLM renders either a decision to call a tool or produces the Final Answer. \n",
    "\n",
    "In case of interleaved thinking, LLM is \"leaking\" its thoughts into the even loop while it's still in that second step - \"LLM is thinking\" - and event loop is configured to executed the tools as soon as LLM \"thinks\" about doing it. What this means is that by the time LLM is done thinking, it actually has the Final Answer, on the very first \"decision\". \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Enabling Interleaved Thinking\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature with Strands and Bedrock:\n",
    "- Set `temperature=1` (required when thinking is enabled)\n",
    "- Add beta header: `\"anthropic_beta\": [\"interleaved-thinking-2025-05-14\"]`\n",
    "- Configure reasoning budget: `\"reasoning_config\": {\"type\": \"enabled\", \"budget_tokens\": 3000}`"
