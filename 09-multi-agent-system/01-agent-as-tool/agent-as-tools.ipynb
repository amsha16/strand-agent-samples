    "\"Agents as Tools\" is an architectural pattern in AI systems where specialized AI agents are wrapped as callable functions (tools) that can be used by other agents. This creates a hierarchical structure where:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A primary \"orchestrator\" agent handles user interaction and determines which specialized agent to call\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Specialized \"tool agents\" perform domain-specific tasks when called by the orchestrator\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach mimics human team dynamics, where a manager coordinates specialists, each bringing unique expertise to solve complex problems. Rather than a single agent trying to handle everything, tasks are delegated to the most appropriate specialized agent.\n",

      "### 1. **Alef Aeronautics Model A**\n",
      "   - **Status**: FAA-approved for test flights\n",
      "   - **Projected Price**: $300,000\n",
      "   - **Features**: Electric power, vertical takeoff and landing, transition to forward flight\n",
      "   - **Notes**: In 2023, Alef's Model A received special airworthiness certification from the FAA, marking a significant milestone toward commercial production. It resembles a conventional car but can take off vertically and transition to forward flight.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. **Joby Aviation S4**\n",
      "   - **Status**: Advanced testing phase, FAA certification in progress\n",
      "   - **Projected Price**: Will likely operate as air taxi service rather than private ownership\n",
      "   - **Features**: Electric power, vertical takeoff and landing, 150-mile range, speeds up to 200 mph\n",
      "   - **Notes**: Joby acquired Uber Elevate and has backing from Toyota. The company aims to launch commercial air taxi services in the coming years.\n",

      "### 3. **Lilium Jet**\n",
      "   - **Status**: Prototype testing\n",
      "   - **Projected Price**: Will operate as air taxi service\n",
      "   - **Features**: 36 electric jet engines mounted on tilting wings, 186-mile range\n",
      "   - **Notes**: The distinctive design uses numerous small electric jets rather than large rotors, potentially offering better efficiency and lower noise.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. **AeroMobil 4.0**\n",
      "   - **Status**: Production plans announced\n",
      "   - **Projected Price**: $1.2-1.6 million\n",
      "   - **Features**: Hybrid design that functions as both car and aircraft, transforms between modes in under 3 minutes\n",
      "   - **Notes**: More traditional \"flying car\" design that can drive on roads and fly, rather than just an aircraft that can take off vertically.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. **Klein Vision AirCar**\n",
      "   - **Status**: Completed test flights, received Certificate of Airworthiness from Slovak Transport Authority\n",
      "   - **Projected Price**: Expected around $600,000\n",
      "   - **Features**: Transforms from car to aircraft in 2-3 minutes, requires runway for takeoff\n",
      "   - **Notes**: Has successfully completed intercity flights in Slovakia.\n",

      "## Considerations When Evaluating Flying Cars\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Regulatory Approval**: Check if the model has FAA or equivalent certification for your region.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Infrastructure Requirements**: Some models need runways while others can take off vertically from small spaces.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Pilot Requirements**: Most current models require a pilot's license to operate.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Range and Speed**: Consider typical journey distances when evaluating battery range.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Safety Features**: Look for redundant systems, ballistic parachutes, and collision avoidance technology.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Operating Costs**: Beyond the purchase price, consider maintenance, energy costs, insurance, and storage.\n",
      "\n",
      "## The Reality Check\n",
      "\n",
      "It's important to note that while flying cars are advancing rapidly, most are still not available for immediate consumer purchase. Many companies are focusing on air taxi services rather than private ownership initially, due to regulatory complexities and infrastructure limitations.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're interested in this technology, you might consider:\n",
      "- Joining waiting lists for models nearing production\n",
      "- Investing in companies developing this technology\n",
      "- Following developments in urban air mobility infrastructure\n",
      "- Getting your pilot's license to be prepared when these vehicles become available\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Flying cars are transitioning from science fiction to reality, but the industry is still in its early stages. The most advanced projects are focusing on air taxi services rather than personal ownership in the immediate term, though several companies are working toward consumer models. For those eager to embrace this technology, staying informed about regulatory developments and company progress is key to making informed decisions when these vehicles eventually reach the market."

      "# Spain: A Comprehensive Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the information gathered, here's a detailed overview of Spain covering its history, culture, geography, economy, and major attractions:\n",
      "\n",
      "## General Overview\n",
      "Spain, officially the Kingdom of Spain, is a country located in Southern and Western Europe with territories in North Africa. It is the largest country in Southern Europe and the fourth-most populous European Union member state. Spain's capital and largest city is Madrid, with other major urban areas including Barcelona, Valencia, Seville, Zaragoza, Málaga, Murcia, and Palma de Mallorca.\n",
      "\n",
      "## History\n",
      "The history of Spain dates back to pre-Roman times when the Mediterranean coast of the Iberian Peninsula had contact with Greeks and Phoenicians. During Classical Antiquity, the peninsula experienced successive colonizations by Greeks, Carthaginians, and Romans. Native peoples of the peninsula, such as the Tartessos, intermingled with these colonizers to create a uniquely Iberian culture.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Romans referred to the entire peninsula as Hispania, from which the modern name \"Spain\" originates. Following the decline of the Western Roman Empire, Spain experienced invasions by Germanic tribes during the 4th and 5th centuries AD, leading to the establishment of Germanic kingdoms and marking the beginning of the Middle Ages in Spain.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Culture\n",
      "Spanish culture is shaped by its Western heritage, interactions with other European cultures, its historically Catholic religious tradition, and diverse national and regional identities within the country. Spanish culture encompasses:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Literature, music, and visual arts\n",
      "- Distinctive cuisine\n",
      "- Customs, beliefs, institutions, and social norms\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond Spain's borders, Spanish culture forms a major component of most Latin American cultures and has been an important influence on Filipino culture, reflecting Spain's colonial history.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Geography\n",
      "Spain occupies most of the Iberian Peninsula in southwestern Europe. Its territory also includes:\n",
      "\n",
      "- The Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean\n",
      "- The Canary Islands in the Atlantic Ocean (108 km off northwest Africa)\n",
      "- A small exclave inside France called Llívia\n",
      "- Five places of sovereignty on and off the coast of North Africa: Ceuta, Melilla, Islas Chafarinas, Peñón de Alhucemas, and Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera\n",
      "\n",
      "Peninsular Spain is bordered to the north by France, Andorra, and the Bay of Biscay; to the east and south by the Mediterranean Sea and Gibraltar; and to the west by Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean. Spain features the southernmost point of continental Europe.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Economy\n",
      "Spain has a highly developed social market economy, ranking as the world's 12th largest by nominal GDP and the sixth-largest in Europe. Key facts about Spain's economy include:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Member of the European Union, eurozone, OECD, and World Trade Organization\n",
      "- 17th-largest exporter and 17th-largest importer globally (as of 2024)\n",
      "- Ranked 28th in the UN Human Development Index and 30th in GDP per capita by the IMF\n",
      "- Major economic sectors: automotive industry, medical technology, chemicals, shipbuilding, tourism, and textiles\n",
      "- Strong social security system that comprises approximately 23% of GDP\n",
      "\n",
      "## Tourism and Major Attractions\n",
      "Tourism is a vital sector of Spain's economy, contributing 12.3% to the country's GDP. International tourist expenditure reached approximately 126 billion euros in 2024. Since 1959, tourism has become one of the key sectors of the Spanish economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Spain's foreign tourist industry is the second-largest in the world, attracting visitors primarily from the United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Germany, Italy, the Benelux countries, and the United States. The country is especially popular for summer holidays.\n",
      "\n",
      "Major attractions include:\n",
      "- The Alhambra palace complex in Granada\n",
      "- Antoni Gaudí's architectural works in Barcelona, including Sagrada Familia\n",
      "- The Prado Museum in Madrid\n",

      "\n",
      "Generative AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that can create new content including text, images, audio, video, code, and synthetic data.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Core Technologies and Methods\n",
      "\n",
      "**Foundation Models**: Large-scale neural networks trained on vast datasets that serve as the basis for various generative applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Transformer Architecture**: The dominant neural network architecture powering most modern generative AI systems, introduced in the paper \"Attention Is All You Need\" (Vaswani et al., 2017)[1].\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Training Approaches**: Most systems use self-supervised learning, where the model learns patterns from unlabeled data, often predicting masked or future elements[2].\n",
      "\n",
      "## Major Categories of Generative AI\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Large Language Models (LLMs)**\n",
      "   - Examples: GPT-4 (OpenAI), Claude (Anthropic), Llama (Meta), PaLM/Gemini (Google)\n",
      "   - Capabilities: Text generation, translation, summarization, question-answering, and reasoning[3]\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Image Generation Models**\n",
      "   - Examples: DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, Midjourney\n",
      "   - Technologies: Diffusion models, GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks), VAEs (Variational Autoencoders)[4]\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Audio/Music Generation**\n",
      "   - Examples: AudioLM, MusicLM, Jukebox\n",
      "   - Applications: Voice synthesis, music composition, sound effects[5]\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Video Generation**\n",
      "   - Examples: Sora (OpenAI), Lumiere (Google), Gen-2 (Runway)\n",
      "   - Still emerging but advancing rapidly[6]\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Code Generation**\n",
      "   - Examples: GitHub Copilot, CodeLlama\n",
      "   - Applications: Code completion, debugging, translation between languages[7]\n",
      "\n",
      "## Technical Challenges\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Hallucinations**: Models can generate plausible but factually incorrect information[8]\n",
      "- **Bias**: Systems may reproduce or amplify biases present in training data[9]\n",
      "- **Computational Requirements**: Training and running advanced models requires significant computing resources[10]\n",
      "- **Context Window Limitations**: Many models have constraints on how much information they can process at once[11]\n",
      "\n",
      "## Ethical and Societal Implications\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Copyright and Intellectual Property**: Questions about training on copyrighted works and ownership of generated content[12]\n",
      "- **Employment Impact**: Potential disruption to creative and knowledge work professions[13]\n",
      "- **Misinformation Concerns**: Ease of generating convincing fake content[14]\n",
      "- **Privacy Issues**: Models may memorize and potentially reproduce private information from training data[15]\n",
