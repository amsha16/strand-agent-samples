    "\n",
    "In this example, we'll create a **Travel Planning System** with:\n",
    "1. A Flight Booking Assistant with long-term memory of travel preferences and history\n",
    "2. A Hotel Booking Assistant with long-term memory of accommodation preferences\n",
    "3. A Travel Coordinator that orchestrates these specialized agents\n",
    "\n",
    "Each specialized agent will access its own namespace within a common memory store, enabling them to build persistent understanding of user preferences over time. This approach demonstrates how complex domains can be broken down into specialized agents that share a memory infrastructure but maintain their own areas of expertise.\n",
