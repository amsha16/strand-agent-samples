    "## Overview\n",

    "## Scenario Context\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you'll step into the role of a Culinary Assistant designed to deliver highly personalized restaurant recommendations. By leveraging AgentCore Memory's long-term retention and automatic information extraction, the agent can remember user preferences—such as dietary choices and favorite cuisines—across multiple conversations. This persistent memory enables the agent to provide tailored suggestions and a seamless user experience, even as conversations span days or weeks. The scenario demonstrates how structured memory organization and configurable strategies empower conversational AI to move beyond short-term recall, creating truly engaging and context-aware interactions.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Short-Term Storage**: The complete conversation is saved in raw form\n",
    "2. **Extraction Trigger**: The memory system detects that this memory has the UserPreference strategy configured\n",
    "3. **Background Processing**: Without any additional code, the system:\n",
    "   - Analyzes the conversation for preference indicators\n",
    "   - Identifies statements like \"I'm vegetarian\" and \"I really enjoy Italian cuisine\"\n",
    "   - Extracts these preferences into structured data\n",
    "4. **Long-Term Consolidation**: The extracted preferences are saved in the configured namespace (`user/{actorId}/preferences`)\n",
