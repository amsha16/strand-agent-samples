    "### Tutorial Architecture\n",
    "Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Gateway provides unified connectivity between agents and the tools and resources they need to interact with. Gateway plays multiple roles in this connectivity layer:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Security Guard**: Gateway manages OAuth authorization to ensure only valid users / agents access tools / resources.\n",
    "2. **Translator**: Gateway translates agent requests made using popular protocols like the Model Context Protocol (MCP) into API requests and Lambda invocations. This means developers don’t need to host servers, manage protocol integration, version support, version patching, etc.\n",
    "3. **Composer**: Gateway enables developers to seamlessly combine multiple APIs, functions, and tools into a single MCP  endpoint that an agent can use.\n",
    "4. **Keychain**: Gateway handles the injection of the right credentials to use with the right tool, ensuring that agents can seamlessly leverage tools that require different sets of credentials. \n",
    "5. **Researcher**: Gateway enables agents to search across all of their tools to find only the ones that are best for a given context or question. This allows agents to make use of 1000s of tools instead of just a handful. It also minimizes the set of tools that need to be provided in an agent’s LLM prompt, reducing latency and cost. \n",
    "6. **Infrastructure Manager**: Gateway is completely serverless, and comes with built-in observability and auditing, alleviating the need for developers to manage additional infrastructure to integrate their agents and tools. \n",

    "## AgentCore Gateway helps solve the challenge of MCP servers that have large numbers of tools\n",
    "In a typical enterprise setting, agent builders encounter MCP servers that have hundreds or even thousands\n",
    "of MCP tools. This volume of tools poses challenges for AI agents, including poor tool selection accuracy, \n",
    "increased cost, and higher latency driven by higher token usage from excessive tool metadata.\n",
    "This can happen when connecting your agents to third party services (e.g., Zendesk, Salesforce,\n",
    "Slack, JIRA, ...), or to existing enterprise REST services. \n",
    "AgentCore Gateway provides a built in semantic search across tools, \n",
    "which improves agent latency, cost, and accuracy, while still giving those agents the tools they need. \n",
    "Depending on your use case, LLM model, and agent framework, you can see up to 3x better latency by keeping\n",
    "an agent focused on relevant tools versus providing the full set of hundreds of tools from a typical MCP Server.\n",

    "# Understanding fundamentals of AgentCore Gateway Search\n",
    "\n",
    "When you create an AgentCore Gateway, you have the option to indicate that you want Search enabled.\n",
    "For Gateways with search enabled, three things happen:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Vector store is created**. The Gateway service automatically creates a serverless fully-managed vector store for your new Gateway. This enables a full semantic search across your Gateway tools. \n",
    "3. **Vector store is populated**. As you add Gateway Targets to your Gateway, the service automatically uses embeddings behind the scenes to populate the vector store based on the tools from the new Target. The tool metadata comes from the JSON defintions of your tools or the OpenAPI Schema specification for your REST services targets.\n",
    "2. **Search tool (MCP based) is provided**. In addition to all of your user defined tools (from AWS Lambda targets or REST services), the Gateway gets one additional MCP tool that provides semantic search. It is named `x-amz-bedrock-agentcore-search`. The prefix ensures there are no name clashes with your user-defined tools. We may add more tools like that in the future as well. The search tool has a single argument called `query`. When the search tool is invoked, the Gateway service performs a semantic search using that query, matching it against available tool metadata (names, descriptions, input and output schema), and returns the most relevant tools in descending order of relevance."

To prove the point, we use two different topics: math (adding numbers), and food (booking a restaurant reservation), each requiring a different set of tools.\n",
