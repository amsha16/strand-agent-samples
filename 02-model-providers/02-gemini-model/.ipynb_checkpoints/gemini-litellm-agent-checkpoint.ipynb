    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Strands Agents is an SDK that takes a model-driven approach to building and running AI agents in just a few lines of code. Strands supports multiple providers and models hosted anywhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "[LiteLLM](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/) is a unified interface for various LLM providers that allows you to interact with models from Amazon, Anthropic, OpenAI, and many others through a single API. The Strands Agent SDK implements a LiteLLM provider, allowing you to run agents against any model LiteLLM supports.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will show you how to use `gemini-2.0-flash-lite` model hosted in Google as the underlying model in your Strands Agent.\n",
